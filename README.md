__Neon Loop__ is our entry to Ludum Dare 47, in which your goal is to increase your speed as much as possible.
You are a spaceship cruising on a track, and everytime you fly near bricks your ship will gain a tiny bit of speed. But be careful not to hit any, otherwise you will explode!

Also, after flying near 12 bricks, you will have the ability to activate the drill, which will destroy every brick in front of you for a few seconds.

Finally, more bricks will spawn for every half of the loop you travel.

__Controls:__


- Move mouse to move the ship

- Left click to activate the drill

- Mouse wheel to increase/decrease sensitivity
